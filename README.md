# Numerical methods for climate modelling workshop: NCAS summer school 2019

Testing out two different integration schemes for the non-linear shallow water equation.

#### Integration schemes
 - Centred in time centred in space
 - Forwards backwards in time centred in space
 
### Structure

`finite_difference.py` - containes code for the two diffrent integration schemes and for making gifs from the run results.

`comparison.py` - containes code for running the two different integration schemes at different resolutions and comparing the results via RMSE.
